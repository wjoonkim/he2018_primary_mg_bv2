# he2018_primary_mg_bv2

we want to check the difference between primary microglia and bv2

from our observations, bv2 cannot be transduced by wt aav5 as efficiently as primary microglia

is this due to the difference in surface receptors between primary microglia and bv2?

specifically, is aavr differentially expressed between primary microglia and bv2?
