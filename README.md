# How different are primary mouse microglia and BV2 mouse cell line?

from our observations, bv2 cannot be transduced by wt aav5 as efficiently as primary microglia

this is likely due to the difference in surface receptors between primary microglia and bv2, which may affect the entry of aav5 into the cells

specifically, is aavr differentially expressed between primary microglia and bv2?

what about the disease-associated microglia marker axl?
