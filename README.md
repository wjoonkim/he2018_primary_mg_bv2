# How different are primary mouse microglia and BV2 mouse cell line?

from our observations, bv2 cannot be transduced by wt aav5 as efficiently as primary microglia

this is likely due to the difference in surface receptors between primary microglia and bv2, which may affect the entry of aav5 into the cells

specifically, is aavr differentially expressed between primary microglia and bv2?

what about the disease-associated microglia marker axl?

this project was made possible by:
1. the data for primary microglia (shaking + cultured) and BV2 deposited by He et al. (2018) at https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1195-4.
2. adapting the tutorials prepared by HBC Training, which can be found at https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-DGE/.

last but not least, i sincerely thank the authors of the tutorials and creators/maintainers of the packages used!
